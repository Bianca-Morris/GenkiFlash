##About
GenkiFLASH is a simple, but rich freeware flash card program for Japanese language learners. Currently, the program allows users to memorize vocabulary words, but additional functionality, such as the ability to create and import wordlists and practice conjugation patterns, will be added soon.

The word lists and conjugation patterns used coicide with the Genki I & II Textbooks by Eri Banno because these are the textbooks used in Wellesley's Japanese courses. Please note, however, that this program is not in anyway affiliated with the Genki franchise, and access to it is not to be sold for profit under any circumstance.

This project is currently INCOMPLETE. As such, there are many bugs and issues that are listed below. If you find a bug that is not listed below, however, please submit a bug report in the comment section [here](https://biancaallynm.wordpress.com/contact/). 

##Installation
Extract the .zip to your chosen location to install. Locate the genkiFLASH_Testing.exe  file inside of the \dist file and click to start. You may have to make an exception in your antivirus software in order for the program to run properly.

To create a shortcut for your desktop, right click on the .exe file and select 'create shortcut.' Drag and drop the generated file onto your desktop and enjoy!

To uninstall, simply delete the GenkiFlash_V.#.#.# folder, as well as any shortcuts you may have created.

##Known Bugs/Issues
- Pressing "check" multiple times before clicking "next" adds multiple points to the current score, instead of just one.
- Scores do not always order themselves on the high score page correctly.
- Romaji to English translation mode is nonfunctional and results in a game-breaking error.

##To-Do List
Scoring
- Save high scores on program shutdown
- Query player for initials to add to high score page
- Make adding high scores to wall manual
- Fix "check/scoring" bug

Decks & Wordlists
- Add "choose random deck" functionality to menu bar
- Make word lists modular (Maybe even write a program for creating new wordists to use with GenkiFlash...)

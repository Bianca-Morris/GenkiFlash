##About
GenkiFLASH is be a simple, but rich freeware flash card program for Japanese language learners. Currently, the program allows users to memorize vocabulary words, but additional functionality, such as the ability to create and import wordlists and practice conjugation patterns.

The word lists and conjugation patterns used coicide with the Genki I & II Textbooks by Eri Banno because these are the textbooks used in Wellesley's Japanese courses. Please note, however, that this program is not in anyway affiliated with the Genki franchise, and access to it is not to be sold for profit under any circumstance.

This project is currently INCOMPLETE. As such, there are many bugs and issues that are listed below. If you find a bug that is not listed below, however, please submit a bug report in the comment section [here](https://biancaallynm.wordpress.com/contact/). 

##Known Bugs/Issues
- Pressing "check" multiple times before clicking "next" adds multiple points to the current score, instead of just one.
- Scores do not always order themselves on the high score page correctly.
- Romaji to English translation mode is nonfunctional and results in a game-breaking error.

##To-Do List
Scoring
- Save high scores on program shutdown
- Query player for initials to add to high score page
- Make adding high scores to wall manual
- Fix "check/scoring" bug

Decks & Wordlists
- Add "choose random deck" functionality to menu bar
